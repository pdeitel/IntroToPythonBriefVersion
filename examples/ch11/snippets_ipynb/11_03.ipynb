For example, Java’s `int` type can represent only values in the range –2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647. Python allows integers to become arbitrarily large. Continue this section’s IPython session and execute the function call `factorial(50)` to demonstrate that Python supports much larger integers.\n",
