    "**3. _(IPython Session)_** Add a `withdraw` method to class Account. If the withdrawal `amount` is greater than the `balance`, raise a `ValueError`, indicating that the withdrawal `amount` must be less than or equal to the `balance`. If the withdrawal `amount` is less than `0.00`, raise a `ValueError` indicating that the withdrawal `amount` must be positive. If the withdrawal `amount` is valid, subtract it from the `balance` attribute. Create an `Account` object then test method `withdraw` first with a valid withdrawal `amount`, then with a withdrawal `amount` greater than the `balance` and finally with a negative withdrawal `amount`. \n",
