    "**4.5 _(Fill in the Missing Code?)_** Replace the `***`s in the `seconds_since_midnight` function so that it returns the number of seconds since midnight. The function should receive three integers representing the current time of day. Assume that the hour is a value from `0` (midnight) through `23` (11 PM) and that the minute and second are values from `0` to `59`. Test your function with actual times. For example, if you call the function for 1:30:45 PM by passing `13`, `30` and `45`, the function should return `48645`. "
