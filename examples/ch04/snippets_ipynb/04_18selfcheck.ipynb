    "**3. _(IPython Session)_** In this section, we worked with population variance and population standard deviation. There is a subtle difference between the _population variance_ and the _sample variance_. In our example, instead of dividing by 10 (the number of die rolls), sample variance would divide by 9 (which is one less than the sample size). The difference is pronounced for small samples but becomes insignificant as the sample size increases. The `statistics` module provides the functions `variance` and `stdev` to calculate the sample variance and sample standard deviation, respectively. Redo the manual calculations, then use the `statistics` moduleâ€™s functions to confirm this difference between the two methods of calculation.\n",
